This is where the meat of your AngularJS app will live. We have two subfolders in here and a couple JavaScript files at the root of the folder. The app.module.js file will handle the setup of your app, load in AngularJS dependencies and so on. The app.route.js file will handle all the routes and the route configuration. After that we have two subfolders – components and shared. Let’s dive into those next.

Structure:

- components folder
- shared folder

- app.module.js
- app.routes.js
- index.html
